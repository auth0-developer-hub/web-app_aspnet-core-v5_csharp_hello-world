# ASP.NET Core v5/C#: Starter Web App Code Sample

This C# code sample demonstrates how to build web applications using ASP.NET Core v5.

Visit the ["ASP.NET Core v5/C# Code Samples: App Security in Action"](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/code-samples/web-app/aspnet-core) section of the ["Auth0 Developer Resources"](https://developer.auth0.com/resources) to explore how you can secure ASP.NET Core v5 applications written in C# by implementing user authentication with Auth0.

## Why Use Auth0?

Auth0 is a flexible drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to your applications. Your team and organization can avoid the cost, time, and risk that come with building your own solution to authenticate and authorize users. We offer tons of guidance and SDKs for you to get started and [integrate Auth0 into your stack easily](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/code-samples/full-stack).

## Set Up and Run the ASP.NET Core v5 Project

Make sure you have the version 5 of the [dotnet cli tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/) installed and configured on your system and execute the following command from the root directory:

```
dotnet run
```
